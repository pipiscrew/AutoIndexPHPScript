# AutoIndex PHP Script (Directory Indexer)
Mirror of original [https://sourceforge.net/projects/autoindex/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/autoindex/) by `Justin Hagstrom`.  

Is a PHP script that makes a table that lists the files in a directory, and lets users access the files and subdirectories.
It includes searching, icons for each file type, an admin panel, uploads, access logging, file descriptions, and more.

* compatible with PHP8
* made responsive (by adding `meta viewport` at `global_header.tpl`)

---

* Included also a poor bootstrap3 implementation by [adayth](https://github.com/adayth/autoindex/tree/master) in folder `_templatesBS3`. Just replace the `template` folder with `_templatesBS3`. Files listed without filesize, cannot find the logic behind..

* Another implementation is by [BeitDina](https://github.com/BeitDina/AutoIndex).
